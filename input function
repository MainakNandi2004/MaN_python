#input function:-In Python, the input() function is used to take input from the user.
a=input("For eg: ") # I am gonna input "Python"
b=input("->") # I am gonna input "is a high level langugae"
print("The truth is ",a+b) # So it will give "Python is a high level langugae" as output because it is taking the input as string and not int
# So to convert it to int we have to do this
#print("The truth is ", int (a)+int(b)) if it gives error then it is ok as the input is not a number to make it a number we have to put int before 'input'
# or we can do this a=int(input("For eg: ")) same for b
