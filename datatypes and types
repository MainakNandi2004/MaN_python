#data types:-In Python, data types are classifications that specify the type of value a variable can hold.
#I think you all know that well or just google it its quite same for every language
a=1 #int
b=1.1 #float
c="Mainak" #string
d="69.7" #string #something which is under quotes whether it is numbers or alphabets it is a str
e=True #bool
f=None #NoneType
g=float(d) #converting str to float....but the type should be float
h=str(a) #converting int to float .... as it will store the value in string format i.e. within quotes
#this converting of datatypes is called typecasting
print("The data types are\n", a,b,c,d,e,g,h)
print("The data types are\n", type(a), type(b), type(c), type(d), type(e) , type(g) , type(h))
