#operators:-In Python, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
# They can be classified into several categories, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.
#examples of operators include:
a= "+,-,*,/,%,/\n"   #(arithmetic operators) 
b= "==,!=,>,<,>=,<=/\n" #(comparison operators)  
c= "and, or, not\n" #(logical operators)
d= "=, +=, -=, *=, /=\n" #(assignment operators) 
e= "&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>\n" #(bitwise operators)
print("Operators in Python are used to perform operations on variables and values \n", a,b,c,d,e)
