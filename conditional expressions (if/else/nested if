#nested if statements are used to check multiple conditions
#for example:
a = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # I am gonna put 18
if a >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote")
    if a >= 21:
        print("You are eligible to drink alcohol")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to drink alcohol")
print("Thank you for the input")  # This will print a thank you message after the program ends
