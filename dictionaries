#dictionaries:-In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs that are unordered and changeable.
#Dictionaries are defined by enclosing the key-value pairs in curly braces {} and separating them with commas.
#Here is an example of a dictionary:
my_dict = {
    "name": "Mainak",
    "age": 21,
    "city": "Kolkata",
    "hobbies": ["coding", "workout", "gaming"], # list inside a dictionary
     00: "zero",  # integer key with string value
    "is_married": False,  # boolean key with boolean value
}
print("The dictionary is:\n", my_dict)  # This will print the dictionary
print(my_dict["city"])  # This will print the value of the key "name" in the dictionary
