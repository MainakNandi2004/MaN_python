 #start and end of string
name = "mainak"  # This is a string
print(name.endswith("nak"))  # will print True if the string ends with "nak" else False
print(name.startswith("nak"))  # will print false if the string does not start with "nak" else True
#counting the number of characters in a string
name = "Mainak"  # This is a string
print("The number of characters in the string is:\n", name.count("a"))  # This will print the number of times "a" appears in the string
print("The number of characters in the string is:\n", name.count("n"))  # This will print the number of times "n" appears in the string
print (name.capitalize())  # This will capitalize the first letter of the string
print (name.upper())  # This will convert the string to uppercase same for lower case we can use name.lower()
#find the index of a character in a string
print(name.find("n"))  # This will print the index of the first occurrence of "n" in the string
#replace a character in a string
print(name.replace("a", "o"))  # This will replace all occurrences of "a
#reverse a string
print(name[::-1])  # This will reverse the string by slicing it from the end to the beginning
# there are many escape sequences in python like \n for new line, \t for tab, \\ for backslash, \' for single quote, \" for double quote, etc. which I have used here for more just search in chatgpt or google "escape sequences in python"
