q={"orange", "kiwi", "banana"}  # This is another set
print("The union of the two sets is:\n", s.union(q))  # This will print the union of the two sets
print("The intersection of the two sets is:\n", s.intersection(q))  # This will print the intersection of the two sets
print("The difference of the two sets is:\n", s.difference(q))  # This will print the difference of the two sets
