#some functions of strings
#slicing of strings
name = "Mainak"  # This is a string
nameshort = name[0:4]  # This will give the first 5 characters of the string and 4th character is not included
print("The first 4 characters of the string are: \n", nameshort)  # This will print the first 5 characters of the string
character = name[1]  # This will give the first character of the string like this we can print 0-M,1-a,2-i,3-n,4-a,5-k
print( "The character of the string is: \n", character)  # This will print the first character of the string
# negative slicing of strings
print(name[-1])  # This will print the last character of the string
print(name[-5:-1])  # This will print the characters from 4th last to 1st last character of the string
print(name[1:5]) # This will print the characters from 1st to 4th character of the string
print(name[1:])  # This will print the characters from 1st to last
print(name[:4])  # This will print the characters from 0th to 4th character of the string
#slicing by skipping characters
print(name[0:5:2])  # This will print the characters from 0 to 6th character of the string by skipping every 2nd character
#first character will comne then alternate second will delete 



#length of string
name = "Mainak"  # This is a string
print("The length of the string is:", len(name))  # This will print the length



 #start and end of string
name = "mainak"  # This is a string
print(name.endswith("nak"))  # will print True if the string ends with "nak" else False
print(name.startswith("nak"))  # will print false if the string does not start with "nak" else True
#counting the number of characters in a string
name = "Mainak"  # This is a string
print("The number of characters in the string is:\n", name.count("a"))  # This will print the number of times "a" appears in the string
print("The number of characters in the string is:\n", name.count("n"))  # This will print the number of times "n" appears in the string
print (name.capitalize())  # This will capitalize the first letter of the string
print (name.upper())  # This will convert the string to uppercase same for lower case we can use name.lower()
#find the index of a character in a string
print(name.find("n"))  # This will print the index of the first occurrence of "n" in the string
#replace a character in a string
print(name.replace("a", "o"))  # This will replace all occurrences of "a
#reverse a string
print(name[::-1])  # This will reverse the string by slicing it from the end to the beginning
# there are many escape sequences in python like \n for new line, \t for tab, \\ for backslash, \' for single quote, \" for double quote, etc. which I have used here for more just search in chatgpt or google "escape sequences in python"
#{there are many string functions here are some of them for more you can check in chatgpt or google by searching "the most used string functions in python"}
