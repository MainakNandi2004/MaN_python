Let me walk you through the roadmap for learning Python step by step:

‚û°Ô∏è MODULES TO COVER:

1. Comments
2. Variables
3. Data Types
4. String Operations
5. Lists
6. Tuples
7. Dictionaries
8. Sets
9. Conditional Statements (if, else, elif)
10. Loops (for and while)
11. Functions
12. Recursion
13. Modules and Packages

‚û°Ô∏è HOW TO STUDY:

- I've included all the essential example codes to help you understand each concept.
- This roadmap is designed even for those with **no prior coding experience**.
- If any part of the code confuses you, feel free to paste it into an AI explanation tool (like ChatGPT) for line-by-line understanding.
- The best way to learn is to **try writing your own versions** of the code. Use math formulas, daily problems, or small projects as inspiration.

‚û°Ô∏è AFTER EACH MODULE:

- Go through the corresponding **folder form** in this repository.
- Try every code, modify them, and solve the extra problems to solidify your understanding.

I'll keep pushing new codes to help you keep practicing and growing.

That's all!

üéâ **HAPPY CODING!** üéâ
