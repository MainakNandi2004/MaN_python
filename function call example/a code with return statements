#let's do a code with return as it holds a value for a variable which we can store for future use
import math
def vol(r,h):
    volume=math.pi*r**2*h
    return volume
r=int(input("Enter the radius"))
print("The radius is "+ str(r))
h=int(input("Enter the height"))
print("The radius is "+ str(h)) 
volume=vol(r,h) 
print("The volume is "+f"{volume}"+" cubic units")
#let's add 1 with the main volume 
volume_1= volume+1
print(f"{volume_1}"+ " is the value after adding 1")
#so you can see here that the return has stored the value with the variable "volume" in the function  `and we can use it multiple times in any execution
